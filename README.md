# System RGB Sync with Pywal Colors

A simple Python script that syncs your system's RGB lighting with the colors generated by [pywal](https://github.com/dylanaraps/pywal), bringing vibrant aesthetics to your setup.

## Features
- **Sync RGB with Pywal**: Automatically adjust the RGB lighting of your system to match the colors generated by `pywal`.
- **Effortless Integration**: Integrates seamlessly with your existing `pywal` setup, making it a perfect enhancement for your colorful environment.
- **Minimal Setup**: Simple and easy to use with a few lines of code.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- `pywal` (for generating color schemes)
- RGB controller software or hardware that can be controlled by the system.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/system-rgb-sync.git
    cd system-rgb-sync
    ```

2. Install the necessary Python dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Ensure that `pywal` is installed and working on your system:
    ```bash
    pip install pywal
    ```

## Usage

1. **Generate colors with pywal**:
    First, run `pywal` to generate your color scheme:
    ```bash
    wal -i /path/to/your/wallpaper
    ```

2. **Sync RGB lighting**:
    Run the Python script to sync your RGB lights with the generated colors:
    ```bash
    python sync_rgb.py
    ```

    This will automatically adjust your RGB lights to match the `pywal` color palette.

## How it Works
- The script reads the `pywal` generated colors from the `~/.cache/wal/colors.json` file.
- It extracts the color palette and sends RGB commands to your lighting hardware/software to match the colors.
- You can customize the RGB controller integration as per your hardware/software setup.
